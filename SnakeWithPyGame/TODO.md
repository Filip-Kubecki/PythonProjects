TODO:
- add sounds to game:
  - background music,
  - sounds on actions: game over, apple eaten etc
- add obstacles to board
- add textures to the game: obstacles
- add leader board to game - score tracking

Bugs:
- when Snake HEAD texture collide into Snake SEGMENT, textures overlap. Make it so the game over screen appear before overlap
- apple can be rendered insider obstacles - happens when apple eaten by snake and new one is generated
- add snake collision textures from collisions when HEAD makes turn
