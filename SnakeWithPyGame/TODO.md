TODO:
- add sounds to game:
  - background music,
  - sounds on actions: game over, apple eaten...
- add Board class: 
  - it will contain all objects that are actively on board in the moment,
- add obstacles to board
- add margin around game surface and add there UI elements: counter, timer, etc
- add textures to the game: snake, apple, obstacles
- improve pause and game over screens

Bugs:
- only tail changes into bend segment (it should be the one that doesn't)
