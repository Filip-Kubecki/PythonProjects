TODO:
- add sounds to game:
  - background music,
  - sounds on actions: game over, apple eaten etc
- add obstacles to board
- add leader board to game - score tracking
- add reaction for achieving maximal snake length (protect game from it)

Bugs:
- apple can be rendered inside snake tail
- add snake collision textures from collisions when HEAD makes turn
- when apple eaten, tail element that is added can break the game if tail is near border of board
